## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.1.0+ is required to build YTLiveStreaming

To integrate YTLiveStreaming into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'YTLiveStreaming'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Prepare and launch an example

As an example used iOS app Live Events

- Download or clone the repository.

- Select Sample folder

- Launch  `pod install`   

- Open LiveEvents.xcworkspace.

- Change current bundle id on your

- Create Config.plist. Copy content Config.plist.example.plist into new Config.plist. Change current values of the client ID and API key on yours.  

- Put CLIENT_ID and API_KEY into the plist.info:

- In Sample/Info.plist edit the CFBundleURLSchemes. Change the value that starts with "com.googleusercontent.apps." based on your API key. It should be set to the reversed API key. The API key has the format XXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com and the allowed URL should be com.googleusercontent.apps.XXXXXXXX

## User guide

	import YTLiveStreaming

	...

	let input: YTLiveStreaming = YTLiveStreaming

	...

	// Get all events in different arrays of the LiveBroadcastStreamModel type
	input.getAllBroadcasts(){ (upcomingEvents, liveNowEvents, completedEvents) in
	   ...
	}

	// Get events separately:

	// Get Ready to broadcast events
	input.getUpcomingBroadcasts() { result in
          switch result {
              case .success(let upcomingEvents):
                ...
              case .failure(let error):
                ...
          }    
	} 

	// Get Live now broadcasts
	input.getLiveNowBroadcasts() ( result in
          switch result {
              case .success(let  liveNowEvents):
                  ...
              case .failure(let error):
                  ...
          }
	} 

	// Get Completed broadcasts
	input.getCompletedBroadcasts() ( result in
             switch result {
                 case .success(let completedEvents):
                     ...
                 case .failure(let error):
                     ...
             }
       } 

	// Create Broadcast
	input.createBroadcast(title, description: description, startTime: startDate, completion: { liveBroadcast in
	   if let liveBroadcast = liveBroadcast {
	      ...
	   }
	})

	// Update of the existing broadcast: LiveBroadcastStreamModel
	input.updateBroadcast(broadcast, completion: { success in
	    if success {
	       ...
	    }      
	})

	// Start broadcast streaming video
	input.startBroadcast(broadcast, delegate: self, completion: { streamName, streamUrl, _ in
	   if let streamName = streamName, let streamUrl = streamUrl {
	     completion(streamUrl, streamName)
	   }
	})

	// Finish broadcast streaming video
	input.completeBroadcast(broadcast, completion: { success in
	   if success {
	      ...
	   }
	})

	// Delete broadcast video from YouTube
	input.deleteBroadcast(id: broadcastId, completion: { success in
