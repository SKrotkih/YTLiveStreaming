	   ...
	}

	// Get events separately:

	// Get Ready to broadcast events
	input.getUpcomingBroadcasts() { result in
          switch result {
              case .success(let upcomingEvents):
                ...

                  ...
          }
	} 

	// Get Completed broadcasts
	input.getCompletedBroadcasts() ( result in
             switch result {
                 case .success(let completedEvents):
                     ...
